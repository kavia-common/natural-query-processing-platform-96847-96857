# DSP Frontend (.env.example)
# Copy to .env and adjust for your environment.

# Backend base URL for API calls from the React app.
# If the frontend is served by the same domain with a reverse proxy, this can be empty.
# For local dev against backend on port 3001:
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3001"
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=""

# Notes:
# - src/api/client.js reads REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL to prefix all API calls.
# - After changing env vars, you must restart the dev server for changes to take effect.
